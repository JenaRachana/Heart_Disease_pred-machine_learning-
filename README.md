## ✔️ Updated README.md You Can Use

Below is an enhanced **README.md template** you can copy into your repository and update further as needed:

```markdown
# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a **machine learning project** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical data. The model analyzes features from a structured dataset and uses classification algorithms to determine whether a person is at risk of heart disease.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training, evaluation, and comparison
- Prediction of heart disease using one or more machine learning models

## 📁 Repository Structure

Heart_Disease_pred-machine_learning-/
├── heart.csv # Dataset containing health attributes
├── heart_disease.ipynb # Notebook with analysis & model implementation
├── main.py # Python script for running prediction
├── requirement.txt # Dependencies for the project
├── README.md # Project documentation


---

## 🚀 Features

✔ Load and explore health dataset  
✔ Clean and preprocess data  
✔ Train machine learning models such as:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
✔ Evaluate model performance  
✔ Predict heart disease from new inputs

---

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses a heart disease dataset that includes common clinical and demographic features like:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- etc.

> **Note:** This dataset may be based on the UCI Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle. You can update the source link if using another source.
